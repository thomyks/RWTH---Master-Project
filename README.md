# Automated Narrative Detection (Reordering Unstructured Fact-Checked Claims into Narratives)

## Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for the "Reordering Unstructured Fact-Checked Claims into Narratives" initiative, also known as the Automated Narrative Discovery project. Using different text-mining techniques, we established a  framework for unstructured fact-checked claims and transformed them into well-defined narratives. We aim to enable a deeper understanding of how disparate pieces of verified information can be woven into coherent stories, particularly within large datasets.

## 📁 Components

### 📈 Dataset
Contained within this directory is the dataset foundational to our research.

### 📉 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Here, we'll take a look at our initial approach to understanding the dataset. This includes a preliminary analysis notebook, providing initial insights and patterns.

### 🧠 Automated Narrative Discovery
This directory contains the core of our project: the algorithms and models designed to generate narratives from text automatically. They encapsulate the core research and method development for this project.

### 📊 Case Study
We explore the real-world applicability of our methodologies with a case study focused on Joe Biden and COVID-19-related claims. This illustrates the practical usage of our automated narrative discovery in topical and narrative formation.

### ✔️ Evaluation
Our evaluation segment details a thorough two-tiered testing procedure that assesses the robustness of our framework. By examining the narrative and topic outputs, we ensure the accuracy and depth of our analytical model.

### 📝 Final Report and Presentation
Within this directory, you will find a comprehensive report and presentation detailing the methodologies and findings of our project. It serves as a culmination of the research and offers an in-depth discussion of the results and their implications.
