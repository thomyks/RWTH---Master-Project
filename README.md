# Reordering Unstructured Fact-Checked Claims into Narratives

## Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for the "Reordering Unstructured Fact-Checked Claims into Narratives" initiative, also known as the Automated Narrative Discovery project. We aim to transform unstructured fact-checked claims into well-defined narratives using automated techniques. We aim to enable a deeper understanding of how disparate pieces of verified information can be woven into coherent stories, particularly within large datasets.

## 📁 Components

### 📈 Dataset
Contained within this directory is the dataset foundational to our research.

### 📉 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Here, we'll take a look at our initial approach to understanding the dataset. This includes preliminary analysis scripts, notebooks, and visual data representations, providing initial insights and patterns.

### 🧠 Automated Narrative Discovery
This directory contains the core of our project: the algorithms and models designed to generate narratives from text automatically. They encapsulate the core research and method development for this project.

### 📊 Case Study
Explore the real-world applicability of our methodologies with a case study centred around Joe Biden and COVID-19-related claims. This illustrates the practical usage of our automated narrative discovery in topical and narrative formation.

### ✔️ Evaluation
Our evaluation segment details a thorough two-tiered testing procedure that assesses the robustness of our framework. By examining both the narrative and topic outputs, we ensure the accuracy and depth of our analytical models.
