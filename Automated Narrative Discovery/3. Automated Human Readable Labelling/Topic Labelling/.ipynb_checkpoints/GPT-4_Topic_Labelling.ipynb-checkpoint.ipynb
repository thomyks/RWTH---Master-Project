    "# Automatic Topic Labelling with OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This document describes a Python script used for processing a CSV file containing topics. The script uses the OpenAI API to generate human-readable labels and domain names for each topic, and then outputs the enhanced data to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- `openai`: For using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n",
    "- `csv`: For reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "- `json`: For JSON parsing.\n",
    "- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Flow\n",
    "1. **Setup OpenAI API Key**: Load the OpenAI API key from an environment variable for security.\n",
    "2. **CSV File Paths**: Set file paths for the input CSV (`biden_topic_info.csv`) and the output CSV (`biden_topic_labelled.csv`).\n",
    "3. **Reading CSV File**: Read the CSV file and store rows in a list.\n",
    "4. **Processing Each Row**: Extract columns like `Topic`, `Representation`, and `Representative_Docs` from each row.\n",
    "5. **Generating Labels with OpenAI**: Use OpenAI's ChatCompletion model to generate labels and domain names based on the topic data.\n",
    "6. **Handling Response**: Split the response from OpenAI into label and domain, and update each row with this new information.\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**: Implement exception handling for robust processing.\n",
    "8. **Writing to a New CSV File**: Write the updated data with labels and domain names to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This script demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model for enhancing CSV data, particularly for labeling topics and categorizing them into specific domains.\n"
