    "# Narrative Labelling with GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This document outlines a Python script designed to process multiple CSV files containing narrative data. The script generates overarching labels for sets of claims and entities using OpenAI's API, and outputs these labels to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- `openai`: To leverage OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n",
    "- `csv`: For handling CSV file operations.\n",
    "- `os`: To interact with the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Description\n",
    "1. **OpenAI API Key Setup**: The script loads the OpenAI API key from an environment variable.\n",
    "2. **Function to Process CSV**: A dedicated function (`process_csv`) reads a CSV file, extracts unique entities and claims from the rows, and returns them.\n",
    "3. **Directory and Output File Setup**: The script sets up the directory containing narrative CSV files (`Narratives/`) and the path for the output CSV (`Narrative/narrative_labelling.csv`).\n",
    "4. **Iterating Through Files**: The script iterates through each CSV file in the directory, processing those that fit the narrative data format.\n",
    "5. **Generating Super Labels with OpenAI**: For each file, it combines the claims and entities and sends them to OpenAI's model to generate a comprehensive label that represents the overall topic.\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling for robust processing.\n",
    "7. **Writing Results to CSV**: The generated labels (`super labels`) are written to a new CSV file along with the respective file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The script efficiently processes narrative data from multiple CSV files, using OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create succinct, overarching labels that summarize the content of each file.\n"
